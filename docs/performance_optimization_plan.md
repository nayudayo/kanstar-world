   - Add intersection observer optimizations

### Step 4: Memory Management
Status: [‚è≥] Not Started

Planned Actions:
- Implement resource cleanup
- Add memory monitoring
- Optimize state management
- Add garbage collection triggers

## Success Criteria
- Initial load screen < 5s on average connection ‚úÖ
- Video playback smooth at 60fps ‚úÖ
- Memory usage < 100MB üîÑ
- No loading screens after initial load ‚úÖ
- Zero animation stutters üîÑ
- Cache hit rate > 90% üîÑ

## Current Focus
1. Monitor performance metrics of optimized videos
2. Continue animation performance optimization
3. Begin memory management implementation

## Notes
