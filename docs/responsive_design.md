# Kanstar World - Responsive Design Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing responsive design across the Kanstar World website. Our approach uses large screen configurations as the baseline, with proportional scaling down for smaller screens. This ensures optimal viewing experience on large displays while maintaining usability across all device sizes.

## Core Objectives
- ✓ Maintain current large screen configurations as the optimal baseline
- ✓ Implement proportional scaling for smaller screens
- ✓ Preserve the cosmic theme and interactive elements across all sizes
- ✓ Ensure smooth animation performance with reduced complexity on smaller screens

## Design System

### Breakpoints (Large Screen First)
```typescript
screens: {
  // Base is large screen (no prefix needed)
  '2xl': '1536px',  // Desktops ✓
  'xl': '1280px',   // Large laptops ✓
  'lg': '1024px',   // Small laptops ✓
  'md': '768px',    // Tablets ✓
  'sm': '640px',    // Large phones ✓
  'xs': '375px'     // Small phones ✓
}
```

### Typography Scale
✓ Implemented with responsive scaling across all breakpoints

### Spacing Scale
✓ Implemented with consistent proportional scaling
