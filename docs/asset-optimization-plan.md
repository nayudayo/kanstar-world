   - Reduced CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
   - Improved LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)

4. Validation Points:
   - Lighthouse performance scores
   - Core Web Vitals measurements
   - Visual regression testing

Dependencies:
- Next.js 13+ installation
- Image optimization configuration in next.config.js

Completion Criteria:
- [ ] All images using next/image
- [ ] Blur placeholders implemented
- [ ] Priority loading configured
- [ ] Performance metrics improved

### Step 2: Asset Conversion Pipeline
Status: [ ] Not Started

Description:
Create automated WebP conversion script for all image assets

Specifications:
1. Core Operations:
   - Set up Sharp.js for image processing
   - Create conversion script
   - Implement quality optimization
   - Generate WebP variants

2. Input Requirements:
   - Original image assets
   - Quality settings
   - Output path configuration

3. Output Expectations:
   - WebP versions of all assets
   - Optimized file sizes
   - Maintained visual quality

4. Validation Points:
   - File size reduction
   - Visual quality comparison
   - Browser compatibility

Dependencies:
- Sharp.js installation
- Original asset inventory

Completion Criteria:
- [ ] Conversion script created
- [ ] All assets converted to WebP
- [ ] Quality validation completed

### Step 3: Asset Manifest Update
Status: [ ] Not Started

Description:
Update asset manifest to use optimized WebP assets with fallbacks

Specifications:
1. Core Operations:
   - Update ASSET_MANIFEST structure
   - Add WebP paths
   - Configure fallback paths
   - Implement dynamic import paths

2. Input Requirements:
   - WebP asset paths
   - Original asset paths
   - Browser support requirements

3. Output Expectations:
   - Updated asset manifest
   - Proper fallback chain
   - Optimized loading paths

4. Validation Points:
   - Asset loading verification
   - Fallback testing
   - Browser compatibility

Dependencies:
- Completed WebP conversion
- Updated file structure

Completion Criteria:
- [ ] Updated manifest structure
- [ ] WebP paths configured
- [ ] Fallbacks implemented

## Module Specifications

### Asset Conversion Module
Purpose: Convert and optimize image assets to WebP format

Algorithm:
1. Core Logic:
   - Read original assets
   - Process through Sharp.js
   - Generate WebP variants
   - Optimize quality/size ratio
   
2. Dependencies:
   - Sharp.js
   - File system access
   - Image metadata
   
3. Constraints:
   - Maximum file size limits
   - Minimum quality thresholds
   - Processing time limits

4. Integration Points:
   - Build pipeline
   - Asset manifest
   - Next.js config

## Success Criteria
- Image load time: <500ms
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
- Total Bundle Size: <2MB
- WebP Conversion: >40% size reduction
- Lighthouse Performance Score: >90

## Implementation Order
1. Next.js Image Component Implementation
2. WebP Conversion Script Creation
3. Asset Manifest Update
4. Quality Validation
5. Performance Testing
6. Browser Compatibility Testing

## Notes
- Consider implementing dynamic imports for below-fold assets
- Monitor memory usage during build process
- Implement error handling for conversion failures
- Consider implementing responsive image sizes
- Document browser support matrix
- Set up monitoring for Core Web Vitals
