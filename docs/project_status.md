## Backend Development Proposal

### 1. User Story & Requirements

#### Tenant System
**User Stories:**
- As an artist, I want to see my NFT collection's performance and royalties

1. Multi-tenant architecture
   - Separate data storage for each artist
   - Isolated user data management
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - JWT-based authentication
   - OAuth2 integration for social logins
   - Role-based permissions system

#### NFT Data Management
**User Stories:**

- As an artist, I want to track royalties from secondary sales
- As an admin, I want to analyze NFT trading patterns

**Technical Requirements:**
1. NFT Data Fetching
   - Integration with NFT marketplaces APIs
   - Real-time price tracking
   - Historical price data storage

2. Analytics System

  - Built-in support for OpenAPI
  - Excellent for microservices

- **Database**:
  - Primary: PostgreSQL
    - Multi-tenant data isolation
    - Complex queries for analytics
  - Cache: Redis
    - Real-time data caching
    - Session management

#### Microservices Architecture
1. **Auth Service**
   - User authentication
   - Token management
   - RBAC implementation

2. **NFT Service**
   - NFT metadata management
   - Price tracking
   - Collection management

3. **Analytics Service**
   - Data aggregation
   - Metrics calculation
   - Report generation

4. **Tenant Service**
   - Tenant management
   - Data isolation
   - Resource allocation

### 3. Implementation Phases
